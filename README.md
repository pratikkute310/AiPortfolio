**Static portfolios are dead.**  
So I built [pratikkute.vercel.app](https://pratikkute.vercel.app/).

Instead of making you scroll endlessly, my portfolio adapts to *you*.  
Ask a question — my AI avatar replies instantly.

## 👇 What can you ask?

- 🧠 **Tech recruiter?** Ask about my stack & results  
- 💻 **Dev?** Dive into my code & mindset  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Friend or family?** See what I’ve been working on  

---

This is not a portfolio.  
It’s a **conversation tailored to your curiosity**.
